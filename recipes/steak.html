            <h3>Rosemary steak has a prime flavor that can not be described with words.</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup red wine</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>4 New York strip steaks, cut 1-inch thick</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>        
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the red wine, salt and rosemary in a small bowl. Let stand at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Heat a large griddle or cast-iron skillet over high heat. Place the steaks on the hot pan, and cook for about 8 minutes per side, or to desired degree of doneness. The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees F (62 degrees C) for medium rare. Pour in the wine mixture, and allow it to boil for a minute. Serve steaks with sauce on a deep platter.</li>
